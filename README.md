# DM_spring_2022
team projects done in Data Mining class in spring semester, 2022.
Uploaded versions are results of practicing HW(we had practicing session every week...) which were done by new opensource dataseets that were selected by our team. Most of the codes I uploaded are the ones I contributed much or I done myself.
There are lot of parts to improve (since I did these projects right after I sereved in the military for 1.5 years, it was hard time recovering all my memories and I found that I need to study more on algorithms and DB).
